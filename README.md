# Jumps_Assembly
This is an x86 assembly program that checks a single character input by the user.  The program prompts the user to "type a character."  It reads the character and checks if it's the ESC key (ASCII 27), which exits the program.  Otherwise, it determines if the character is a number, an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or an unknown character.
